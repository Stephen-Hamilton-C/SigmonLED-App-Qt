# To-do list

Needed and planned features will be placed into this file.

## [TODO]

### Qt6 [PRIORITY]
- [ ] Make note of all errors

### Palette Editor
- [ ] Copy & paste function
- [ ] Swatch color selector
- [ ] Repeating patterns, like have only 2 selections and the pattern sent is simply those 2 colors repeating
	- [ ] Maybe integrate this into Arduino, if it's sent too few colors, then automatically repeat the pattern

### Palette Sharing
- [ ] Look into file permissions

### Communication
- [ ] When connected to Arduino, immediately ask for version and prompt if app is out of date
	- (Backward compatibility is not necessary as SigmonLED is still in Beta)

### About Page
- [ ] Paragraph
- [ ] Version string
- [ ] Arduino version

### QoL
- [ ] Make prompt for location services if they are disabled (needed for BLE)
