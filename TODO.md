## [TODO]

### Qt6 [PRIORITY]
- [ ] Make note of all errors

### Color Editing
- [ ] Copy & paste function
- [ ] Swatch color selector
	- [ ] Recent colors
- [ ] Repeating patterns, like have only 2 selections and the pattern sent is simply those 2 colors repeating
	- [ ] Maybe integrate this into Arduino, if it's sent too few colors, then automatically repeat the pattern

### Palette Sharing

### QoL
- [ ] Make prompt for location services if they are disabled (needed for BLE)
- [ ] Fix layout for regular sized phones (use emulators)

### Layout
