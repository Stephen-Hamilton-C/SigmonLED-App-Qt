This was built for both desktop and Android, but was very messy, and did not feel very good on desktop.
See [SigmonLED-App](https://github.com/Stephen-Hamilton-C/SigmonLED-App) for a specifically made Android app and [SigmonLED-Desktop](https://github.com/Stephen-Hamilton-C/SigmonLED-Desktop) for a specifically made desktop application.

# SigmonLED App
This application allows your device to control a Bluetooth-powered SigmonLED Arduino. See [SigmonLED-Arduino](https://github.com/Stephen-Hamilton-C/SigmonLED-Arduino) for the Arduino code.

The Arduino must use a BLE module for the release version of this app to work.

For the best experience, an HM-10 BLE module from DSD Tech or any BLE module with the first three MAC address groupings set to `64:69:4E` will allow the app to behave as expected.
